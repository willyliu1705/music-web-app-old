> *The Never-Ending Journey to find Good Songs Starts and End Here*
---
## The Idea

This is a lightweight web application that was specifically created to help users find songs.

> Lightweight here refers to the fact that there will be no required sign-ins or paywalls, you search for a song and we instantly provide recommendations.

## Current Available Features

- search an artist's top 10 most popular songs by name or link
- able to upload a song (no further actions)

## Future Features

- search songs similar to the entered song or link
- search for artists with similar styles to the one entered
- be able to filter songs through different metrics
- generate a playlist of similar songs based on an imported a playlist
- export a playlist to a user's preferred streaming service for music
- a recommendation form that allows users to provide feedback and report bugs
- option to play a snippet of the most "popular" or "recognized" part of a song

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

**We are currently migrating the application to a tech stack that uses React and Next.js.**
